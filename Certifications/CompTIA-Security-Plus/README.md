Security+ is the foundational certification for cybersecurity professionals. It's globally recognized, DoD-approved, and covers the core security concepts every IAM professional needs to know. This cert validates that I understand security from the ground up.

## What This Covers

The exam tests knowledge across five domains:

📋 **Domain 1: General Security Concepts (12%)**
- Security controls and fundamental concepts
- Cryptography basics

🎯 **Domain 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations (22%)**
- Threat actors and attack methods
- Vulnerability identification and mitigation

🏗️ **Domain 3: Security Architecture (18%)** ⭐ IAM Focus!
- Enterprise security design
- **Identity and Access Management**
- Cloud security architecture

⚙️ **Domain 4: Security Operations (28%)**
- SIEM, monitoring, and incident response
- Digital forensics and automation

📊 **Domain 5: Security Program Management (20%)**
- Governance, risk, and compliance
- Security policies and awareness

## My Study Approach

I'm taking a structured 10-week approach to ensure I master all domains:
