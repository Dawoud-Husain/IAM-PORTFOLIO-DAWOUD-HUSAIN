## Emergency Revision Plan

If exam is in 2 weeks and you haven't studied enough:

### Week 1 (Intense Cram)
- 3-4 hours daily minimum
- Complete Professor Messer video series (2x speed if needed)
- Create flashcards for key concepts
- Focus on Domains 2, 4, 5 (largest percentage)

### Week 2 (Practice & Review)
- Take 1 practice test daily
- Review all incorrect answers thoroughly
- Focus exclusively on weak areas
- Day before: light review only

**Note:** Not ideal, but possible if necessary. Better to follow the 10-week plan!

---

**Remember:** Consistency beats intensity. 1.5 hours daily is better than cramming 10 hours once a week.

**You've got this!** 💪
